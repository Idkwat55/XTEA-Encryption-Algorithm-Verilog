XTEA:
	- eXtended Tiny Encryption Algorithm
	- Block Cipher
	- Preecursor: TEA
	- Successor: XXTEA
	- 128-bit key & 64-bit data (configurable data size and no. of rounds)
	- Structure: Fiestel Network
	- Authors: David Wheeler & Roger Needham
	- Symmetric encryption
	- Delta constant (derived from Golder ratio - 0x9E3779B9 or ( sqrt(5) - 1) * 2 ** 32) )
	- Uses only simple operations (XOR, Shifts, Addition)

Fiestel Rounds:
	A Feistel structure is a way to build a block cipher where each round of encryption only modifies half the data, using the other half and a round function.

Key features:
	- Lightweight
	- Open source 
	- Simple 
	- Effective
	- Flexible

Applications:
	- Embedded firmware encryption
	- IoT device communication
	- Secure data storage on constrained hardware 
	- Bootloader and BIOS protection
	- Smartcards, RFID, NFC tags with tight gate budget

Best Applications:
	- Super low-end, non-internet-connected devices, or intermittently powered systems like RFID/NFC

improvement Options:
	- Increase data block size, key size for improved security
	- Increase no. of rounds for improved security
	- Data level parallelism (add more cores)
	- Unrolling
